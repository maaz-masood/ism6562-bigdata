# ISM 6562 - Big Data for Business Applications

Repository for ISM 6562 - Big Data for Business Applications at USF.

This course, led by Dr. Tim Smith, focuses on managing and analyzing large-scale 
data using modern technologies like NoSQL databases, distributed file systems, 
and computational frameworks such as Hadoop and Spark. Throughout the semester, 
I will be building hands-on projects involving Docker containerization, 
PostgreSQL sharding, and big data pipelines.

As a current MS-AIBA student and Graduate Teaching Assistant for ISM 4041 (Global 
Cyber Ethics) and ISM 2411 (Python for Business), I’m using this repository to 
document my technical growth in engineering scalable business solutions.
